# US_Voter_Sentiment

In this group school project, we use the American National Election Studies (ANES) 2018 voter sentiment survey dataset to conduct some research and testing in R to answer questions of interest.

You will find:

*  Huang_Parekh_Rashid_Ye_lab_1.pdf : A research report on five research questions.

   1. Do US voters have more respect for police or journalists?
   2. Are Republican voters older or younger than Democratic voters?
   3. Do a majority of independent voters believe that the federal investigations of Russian election interference are true?
   4. Was anger or fear more effective at driving increases in voter turnout.
   5. Are a majority of mail-in voters from the 2018 election more likely to support Biden than other candidates?

Our group discussed and reviewed the write-up for all questions together. My main areas of focus were in Question 3 and Question 5.
